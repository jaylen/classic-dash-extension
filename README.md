# Classic Dash Extension for GNOME

This extension brings classic look-and-feel for the dash panel that gives access to:

 * Applications menu
 * Favourite app launchers
 * Open windows
 * Clock and calendar
 * System actions

It also hides the top bar to allow more space on your screen.

To install, run

```
make install
```

To configure or uninstall, use standard GNOME `gnome-shell-extension-prefs` app.
Look and feel can be adjusted by modifying CSS styles in [stylesheet.css](stylesheet.css).

## System Requirements

Currently this extension is written for and tested on Debian 12 and GNOME 43.
